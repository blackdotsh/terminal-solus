A terminal interface that lets you do various tasks to multiple containers via the SolusVM API

Currently, all API data are stored on disk using 256 bit AES in CBC mode.

There's a lot of debugging stuff I still have enabled since the code is still in early developement.

<br> Available commands:<br>
- add
- stats
- info
- shutdown [host]
